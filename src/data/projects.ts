    description: "A proof of concept wearable signaling device for cyclists that improves communication using LED turn signals, a laser line projector, and electronic horn.",
    fullDescription: "For the LIFETank Engineering Competition hosted by ESC at UCI, I wanted to address the need for better communication between cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians, I designed and built a proof-of-concept wearable signaling device featuring LED turn signals, a laser line projector, and an electronic horn. The goal was to enhance cyclist visibility and predictability on the road while maintaining a compact, ergonomic design that could be worn comfortably. The system architecture centered around an Arduino Nano microcontroller controlling all outputs, with three buttons attached to the side of the index knuckle. Early research focused on identifying gaps in existing safety solutions, which guided the deviceâ€™s focus on adaptability and visibility in low-light and urban environments."
                      "The prototyping process involved a multidisciplinary approach combining electronics, mechanical design, and software development. I began by creating schematics to route power efficiently to the LEDs, laser module, and sound system, writing custom Arduino firmware to handle fast and reliable input responses. After breadboarding, I soldered the final circuits onto an offcut perfboard. I also designed and 3D modeled a custom enclosure using Fusion 360, to encapsulate the electronics. I printed the casing using PLA filament due to material availability. Field testing involved daytime, nighttime, and light rain conditions to assess visibility, durability, and functionality. Based on testing, I upgraded the LEDs for better daylight visibility, moved to a polycarbonate based filament,"
                      "and added a low-battery warning indicator. The final prototype performed smoothly across the board: the LED turn signals provided clear directional intent, the laser line projector provided clear path intention, and the electronic horn offered a crucial safety mechanism for alerting others in dense urban traffic. This project for me tested a wide range of skills, including Arduino programming, PCB prototyping and soldering, 3D modeling and printing, and full-cycle hardware product development. It also helped me in realizing how thoughtful, human-centered design can directly enhance urban mobility and safety. Building this device made me really excited for creating smart, practical solutions for cyclists and other vulnerable road users.",
